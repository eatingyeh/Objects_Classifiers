## 1. Goal
To predict class label for each image in testing set by training CIFAR-10 training set with CNN in keras. And get a model with good performance.
## 2. Dataset
A [dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) contains 60,000 color 32x32 pixels images and are divided into 10 classes, which means each class contains 6,000 images. The training set contains 50,000 images, while the test sets provides 10,000 images.

Class labels: 'Airplane', 'Automobile', 'Bird', 'Cat', 'Deer', 'Dog', 'Frog', 'Horse', 'Ship', 'Truck'

## 3. Tools and Algorithms
- Convolutional Neural Networks : This algorithm is also known as CNN. And it is a deep learning algorithm that can take images as inputs.
- Keras : This is a higher level library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. The purpose of keras is to streamline the process of building those networks.
